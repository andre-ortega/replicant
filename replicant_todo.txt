oh-my-zsh command was clearly wrong and should be placed in a script instead
lualine patch was likely in the wrong place
no idea whats up with treesitter right now
rustup was fine just needs an enter key
zshrc needs to be confidently copied after oh-my-zsh or will be overwritten
chsh also asked for a password for the user
remove $USER after logging in as USER
