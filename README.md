# REPLICANT

Installs and configures an entire software development workstation in a single
command from the Arch Boot ISO. This is an optimized software development
workstation continuously designed to present information and perform
common tasks as quickly as possible.

best places to observe it's behavior.

The following git repositories are pulled during installation:

- suckless-drega
- backup-configs
- nvim-config

- skps
- SARA CLI

SARA CLI, while installed, is not enabled by default.

## FEATURES

- Complete NeoVim installation and configuration
